                                TITLE- Implementaion of State Machines for the pattern detection.



     Objective-  detectecting the pattern in a given sequence.

     Implementation - it will be implemented as program.

     Functionality -   it will ask the user to input the pattern to be detected and the type of machines whether mealy or moore and overlapping or non overlapping. the it will                            take the sequence as input in which the pattern is to be detected. the it will give output as a state graph in the form of texts s1->s2->s3.... the using a                        software we can create a graphical representation of this textual data.
