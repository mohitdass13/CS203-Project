Input           :-   input will be sequences and the pattern to be detected.type mealy or moore will also be input. 
                     type overlapping and non overlapping is also be asked from the user.

Output          :-   the output will be the state graph in the form of text s1,s2... states.

Functionality   :-   our program will first ask the user to enter the pattern to be detected. the it will ask for entering the pattern1 ,pattern2 and so on.
                     then it ask for input the sequence in which the pattern is to be detected. the it will ask to enter the type mealy or moore.
                     and also ask the user to enter the whether overlapping or non overlapping. then the program will form the state graph accordingly.
                     and will give the output in the form of text like  s1->s2->s3....
                     then we will use a software for the graphical representation of the textual data in the form of circles and arrows as taught in the lecture.
